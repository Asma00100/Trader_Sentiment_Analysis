# Trader_Sentiment_Analysis

This project looks at how trader behavior changes during "Fear" and "Greed" market moods.

# What I Did
- Used two datasets: trading activity and Bitcoin Fear-Greed Index
- Merged them by date to study trader performance
- Analyzed trends in trade size, profits, and actions during fear vs. greed

# Key Findings
- Traders buy more in Greed and sell more in Fear
- Bigger and more profitable trades happen during Greed
- More trading activity and higher fees are seen in Greed phases

# Tools Used
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Google Colab
